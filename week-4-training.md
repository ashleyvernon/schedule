# Week 4 Training

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.

### Monday (continued from weekend)

1. Continue the [Express Personal API](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/express-personal-api) project. **Complete Parts 0-2.  Also:**
  
  * add a link to your deployed Heroku site on the "My Work" section of your personal website
  * fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/a/generalassemb.ly/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQgR89hvW-Q-APwntPoaXHkfNr7XMKJXI6GeUsPteVhMOW_Q/viewform) to let us know your site's deployed URL

### Tuesday


1. Looking forward: Write down 3-5 ideas of resources (types of data) that you could build a CRUD app around for Project 1. **Bring this to GA on Wednesday**. 

  * Remember this app will be data-driven (users must be able to create, read, update, and delete your resource). 
  * Your app should not require user login.  Every user should be able to CRUD a resource without logging in, no special permisssions.

2. Read through [Tunely](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/tunely) sprint 2. Read through the solutions and work to understand the code in the controllers, models, `server.js`, and `app.js`. Review any other resources you feel will be helpful for you ( [personal API](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/express-personal-api), the [Mongoose Books App](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/mongoose-books-app) ).  Write down two areas where you feel you are strong (or concepts you understand well) and two areas where you don't feel as confident yet. **Bring this to GA on Wednesday**.
