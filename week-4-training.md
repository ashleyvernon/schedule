# Week 4 Training

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.

### Monday (continued from weekend)

1. Continue the [Express Personal API](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/express-personal-api) project. **Complete Parts 0-2.  Also:**
  
  * add a link to your deployed Heroku site on the "My Work" section of your personal website
  * fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/a/generalassemb.ly/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQgR89hvW-Q-APwntPoaXHkfNr7XMKJXI6GeUsPteVhMOW_Q/viewform) to let us know your site's deployed URL

### Tuesday


1. Looking forward: Write down 3-5 ideas of resources (types of data) that you could build a CRUD app around for Project 1. **Bring this to GA on Wednesday**. 

  * Remember this app will be data-driven (users must be able to create, read, update, and delete your resource). 
  * Your app should not require user login.  Every user should be able to CRUD a resource without logging in, no special permisssions.

2. Review your [personal API](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/express-personal-api), [Tunely](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/tunely), the [Mongoose Books App](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/mongoose-books-app), and any other resources you feel will be helpful for you.  Write down two areas where you feel you are strong (or concepts you understand well) and two areas where you don't feel as confident yet. **Bring this to GA on Wednesday**.
