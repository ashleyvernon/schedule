# Week 6 Training

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.

### Monday

1. Practice with directives!  Choose another UI Bootstrap directive, and add it to your Cards Against Assembly app. Be sure to read the known issues for the directive you choose. Try using the directive's settings to customize it for your page.  

1. Get ready for promises! Spend about 40-60 minutes investigating promises with the resources below:
  * Read the first half of  this [cartoon explanation of promises](http://andyshora.com/promises-angularjs-explained-as-cartoon.html), by Andy Shora. (Stop before "What does this look like in code?")
  * Read the "Description" section of MDN's [JavaScript Promise documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise#Description). What an awesome diagram!
  * Watch this 10-minute video on [Angular's `$q` service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2PBVEgMijo).
  * With any remaining time, briefly look over Angular's [`$q` documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$q) - we'll be using the Deferred API and Promise API (like in the video) instead of `$q` constructor syntax.

1. Based on your research, either answer each of the following questions or write a new, more specific question about the topic:
  * What is a promise?
  * What does it mean for a promise to be pending, fulfilled, resolved, and rejected?
  * How does promise "chaining" work?
  * Draw the lifecycle of a promise.  




### Tuesday

1. Spend about an hour continuing work on this morning's [weather directive challenge](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/making-a-custom-directive). During your work time - whether or not you have successfully completed building the directive - spend some of your time reading through [this solution](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/weather-directive). Use that example to help you to complete your version.
1. Similarly, spend an hour on the [book app service refactor](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/angular-services-training) that you began this afternoon. Make sure to review [the solution branch](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/angular-services-training/tree/solution-31). Additionally, read [the code from the ngResource solution branch](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/angular-services-training/tree/ngResource-solution). This is a different approach that Angular provides that drastically reduces the complexity of the code you need to write, but inherently hides a lot of the specifics behind the Angular scenes. A `$resource` is automatically CRUD-able!

### Wednesday

Angular build!

### Thursday

Angular build!

### Weekend

1. Take about fifteen minutes (total) skimming through the following 3 free books on Ruby. Spend a little time really reading the table of contents (if there is one) and seeing what piques your interest. 

 - http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-1.html
 - http://humblelittlerubybook.com/book/html/index.html
 - http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/
 
 Choose at least one of these books to read more of, and spend at least an hour with it this weekend. (But also get some rest, it's been a long week!) Skip ahead to the topics that interested you most. You can always go back to previous chapters later. 

 > Another great but non-free book is Practical Object Oriented Design (POODR) by Sandi Metz.  For starting out Ruby, you could focus on chapters 1-3.

1. Work through [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0), an interactive introduction to Ruby. The whole tutorial is very useful, but at least do levels 1-4.  _Note: despite what the site says, this will take longer than 15 minutes! Plan to spend an hour on this._

1. Get as far as you can with the Ruby Koans listed below in 1-2 hours. See [ruby-koans.md](ruby-koans.md) for an explanation of Ruby Koans.

 - About Asserts - `about_asserts.rb`. This will help you understand how the tests are working, but it's a new concept. Remember, don't get stuck.
 - About True and False - `about_true_and_false.rb`
 - About Nil - `about_nil.rb`
 - About Strings - `about_strings.rb`

Use any extra time to go farther with the resources above or check out other resources. Here's a possibility:
- [codewars for Ruby](https://www.codewars.com/?language=ruby)
