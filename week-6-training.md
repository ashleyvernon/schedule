# Week 6 Training

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.

### Monday 

1. Get ready for promises! 
  * Read the first half of  this [cartoon explanation of promises](http://andyshora.com/promises-angularjs-explained-as-cartoon.html), by Andy Shora. (Stop before "What does this look like in code?")
  * Watch this 10-minute video on [Angular's `$q` service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2PBVEgMijo). 
  * Read the "Description" section of MDN's [JavaScript Promise documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise#Description). Pay special attention to the diagram. 
  * Look over Angular's [`$q` documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$q) - we'll be using the deferred API and Promise API instead of `$q` constructor syntax.
