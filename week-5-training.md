# Week 5 Training

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.

### Monday (continued from weekend)

1. Fill out the [Project 1 Peer Feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/5fclTh5ipJnI7tgG3) to reflect on your team's work in this project. Your answers will be combined with outside observations of your group as part of project feedback (not shared directly with your partner). Please be honest and fair - this is your way to help your partner improve!

2. Wrap up Project 1. Review the [deliverables](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/project-1#completed-project-deliverables) and [technical requirements](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/project-1#technical-requirements).  You'll have from about 10:30am - 12:15pm to finish up details tomorrow. Don't forget to write your readme and plan what each partner will talk about during the presentation!


### Tuesday

1. Watch this conference presentation called [Inventing on Principle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII). (Protip, watch it at 1.5x or 2x speed to decrease the time commitment.)
2. Read [the Angular Developer's Guide introduction to angular](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/introduction) with these questions in mind:
  * What problems is Angular aiming to address?
  * What terminology is unfamiliar?
  * What questions do you have entering into using Angular?

### Wednesday

1. Finish the "instructions" portion of Tune.ly Angular sprint 1. Give yourself a time limit for trying to get it working independently (maybe 30 minutes). After that time, work through the solutions for sprint 1.  

 > Angular debugging protip: triple-check that you've done every step and spelled everything correctly; there are a lot of variable names and strings that *must* match between your JavaScript and HTML. 

2. Finish [Angular Hangman](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/ng-hangman). When you're finished with it for the evening:
  - Update the readme to have a 3-5 sentence reflection on how the project went for you. 
  - Add a link to your GitHub repo on the "My Work" section of your personal website. 

> **As an additional resource**, you can check out [Code School's AngularJS Tutorial](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/ng-read-create.git). Level 1 covers a lot of the material from today, and level 2 adds on some more interesing directives.
