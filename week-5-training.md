# Week 5 Training

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.

### Monday (continued from weekend)

1. Fill out the [Project 1 Peer Feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/5fclTh5ipJnI7tgG3) to reflect on your team's work in this project. Your answers will be combined with outside observations of your group as part of project feedback (not shared directly with your partner). Please be honest and fair - this is your way to help your partner improve!

2. Wrap up Project 1. Review the [deliverables](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/project-1#completed-project-deliverables) and [technical requirements](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/project-1#technical-requirements).  You'll have from about 10:30am - 12:15pm to finish up details tomorrow. Don't forget to write your readme and plan what each partner will talk about during the presentation!


### Tuesday

1. Watch this conference presentation called [Inventing on Principle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII). (Protip, watch it at 1.5x or 2x speed to decrease the time commitment.)
2. INTRO ANGULAR READING
