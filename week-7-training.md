# Week 7 Training

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.

### Monday

1. Do this [OOP reading](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/ruby-oop-reading), which works through creating a `Car` class. Write down answers to each of the reflection questions at the bottom of the readme, and **bring your answers in with you tomorrow.**  Tips:
  * If you just read through this, you're not getting the full benefit!  Instead, create a Ruby file to follow along with the code examples and run it every step or two with `ruby your_file_name.rb`. Try things out! Would it break if I do `car[color]`?  
  * If you're not feeling cars, create an entirely different class following the same examples (plants? phones? baseball players?)!  **Following along in code is a great strategy for reading docs on unfamiliar topics!**  
  * If you want to split this longer reading up a little, good break points are before "Inheritance" and before "Modules".
 
2. If you have time after the reading, finish the <b>first 3 methods in each of the exercises</b> of this [training](https://github.com/sf-wdi-31/ruby_method_drills). This should only be complete after the OOP Reading.
