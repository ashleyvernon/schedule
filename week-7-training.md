# Week 7 Training

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.

### Monday

1. Do this [OOP reading](), which works through creating a `Car` class.  

  If you just read through this, you're not getting the full benefit!  Instead, create a Ruby file to follow along with the code examples and run it every step with `ruby your_file_name.rb`. If you're not feeling cars, create an entirely different class following the same examples (plants? phones? baseball players?)!  Following along in code is a great strategy for reading docs on unfamiliar topics!
