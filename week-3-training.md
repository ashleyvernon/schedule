## Tuesday

1. Looking forward: Read over [mongoose's getting started guide](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/).
  * Also read the first few sections of Mongoose's [overall guide](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html), up through the section on creating a model. Write out a brief summary of what a mongoose _schema_ is, what a mongoose _model_ is, and how they're different. **Bring this in tomorrow.**  
  * Examine the basic syntax mongoose uses to make a new document, save the document, and find documents later.  You don't have to memorize the methods now, but look over them. 

Please use any remaining time to review today's To Do training. We are not requiring you to add it to your site, but feel free!
